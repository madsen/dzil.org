This is a catalog of Dist::Zilla plugins.  To add a plugin to the
catalog, add it to the appropriate plugin-author.pod file (creating a
new one if necessary) and then submit a pull request on GitHub.

Please use one file per author; this should help avoid merge conflicts.

Extended POD syntax:

  =author CPANID

      This sets the author for all following plugins
      (until the next =author, but there should only be 1 per POD file)

  =plugin PluginName
  tagname tagname...

  Plugin description paragraph.

      This defines a plugin.  Please keep the description short, no
      more than 1 or 2 brief paragraphs.

  =tag tagname

  Tag description paragraph.

      This defines a tag and gives it a description.

This directory also includes find-plugins.pl.  It will scan MetaCPAN for
new plugins and add the descriptions, etc. as new PODs in the new/
directory.  Any existing POD files will be duplicated and extended in the
new/ directory.  This allows you to inspect the results and then copy the
whole directory over.

The script works pretty well in filling in the tags and description, but
sometimes it needs some edits.  Any edits put back into src/plugins/*.pod
will be retained unchanged, so don't worry about the script clobbering 
your changes.
