L<Dist::Zilla>'s L<MakeMaker|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker> plugin is
limited, if you want to stray from the marked path and do something that
would normally be done in a C<package MY> section or otherwise run custom
code in your F<Makefile.PL> you're out of luck.

This plugin is 100% compatable with L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker>, but
if you need something more complex you can just subclass it.  (More details
in the docs.)
