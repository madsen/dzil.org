=plugin Clean

the release.


=plugin GitHub::Create
git version-control

This Dist::Zilla plugin creates a new git repository on GitHub.com when a
new distribution is created with C<dzil new>.

It will also add a new git remote pointing to the newly created GitHub
repository's private URL. See L</"ADDING REMOTE"> for more info.


=plugin GitHub::Meta
git metadata version-control

This Dist::Zilla plugin adds some information about the distribution's
GitHub repository to the META.{yml,json} files, using the official
L<CPAN::Meta> specification.

Note that, to work properly, L<GitHub::Meta> needs the network to connect
to GitHub itself. If the network is not available, it will try to come up
with sensible data, but it may be inaccurate.

This Dist::Zilla plugin updates the information of the GitHub repository
when C<dzil release> is run.
