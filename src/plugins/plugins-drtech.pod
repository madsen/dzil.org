=plugin ModuleBuild::RequireXS

Use this plugin instead of the regular C<ModuleBuild> plugin when you are
relying on XS modules that have a pure Perl fallback, eg L<JSON>,
L<JSON::XS> and L<JSON::PP>.

It generates a F<Build.PL> which will promote XS modules from C<recommends>
to C<requires> if there is a working C compiler. This behaviour can be
disabled by passing a C<--pp> flag to C<Build.PL>.
