=plugin ReportVersions::Tiny
file-gatherer template

This module integrates with L<Dist::Zilla> to automatically add an
additional test to your released software. Rather than testing features of
the software, this reports the versions of all static module dependencies,
and of Perl, at the time the tests are run.

The value of this is that when someone submits a test failure report you
can see which versions of the modules were installed and, hopefully, be
able to reproduce problems that are dependent on a specific set of module
versions.


=plugin Version::FromSubversion
template version version-control version-provider

This plugin build a version number for a release from the Subversion
revision number of the current directory.

B<Using revision numbers of the versioning system is a *really bad* idea:
that will not scale>. For example, it will not work if you start to use
branches and want to make releases from them because revision numbers are
global, and not per branch. So keep this only for small projects and be
prepared to change you version scheme if that goes wrong!
