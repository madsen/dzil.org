bundle prereqs

This is a handy L<Dist::Zilla> plugin bundle that ties together several
useful Prereq plugins: L<AutoPrereqs|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoPrereqs>,
L<MinimumPerl|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumPerl>,
L<MinimumPrereqs|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumPrereqs>,
L<PrereqsClean|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PrereqsClean>.

=plugin MinimumPrereqs
prereqs

This plugin will scan for any "blank" pre-requirement (ie: C<Module => 0>),
search MetaCPAN for the lowest version that was released at least within
C<minimum_year>, and fix the prereq to contain that mimimum version.


=plugin PrereqsClean
prereqs

Ever notice that it's really easy to figure out if a module's author used
Dist::Zilla by the amount of dependencies? strict? warnings? base? Every
module for Foo::Bar::*, individually listed?

Well, now you can clean up that junk. PrereqsClean will find and clean up:

   * Core modules that are already in Perl, verifying minimum version requirements
   * Core modules that only exist in Perl, which will elevate the minimum Perl version if necessary
   * Multiple modules that already exist in a single distribution
