=plugin ChangelogFromGit::Debian
changelog git version-control

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ChangelogFromGit::Debian extends
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ChangelogFromGit> to create changelogs acceptable
for Debian packages.


=plugin Dpkg
install

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Dpkg generates Debian' controls files that you can use
with debhelper to generate packages of your perl module.
There are a handful of tools that provide similar functionality. Most of
them expect your perl module to have a standard installation mechanism.
This module was born of a need for customization. It's projects used
per-package perlbrews and all manner of custom bits.


=plugin Version::Git::Flowish
git template version version-control version-provider

This plugin consumes the Dist::Zilla VersionProvider role and gleans a
version number from Git using a structure similar to Vincent Driessen's
L<git flow|http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/> model.
The idea is to facilitate automated systems, such as continuous
integration, to divine version numbers from the branching and release
strategies used in our repositories.
