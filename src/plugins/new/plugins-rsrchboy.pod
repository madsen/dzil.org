=plugin Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch
before-release git version-control

This plugin checks that you are on the correct branch before allowing
a release.  It prevents accidental releases being cut from topic
branches.


=plugin Git::CheckFor::Fixups
before-release git version-control

This plugin checks that you have no fixup or squash commits remaining
in your history since the last release.  The presence of these commits
is almost certainly an oversight, so if any are found the release is
aborted.


=plugin @Git::CheckFor
bundle git version-control

This bundles several plugins that do some sanity/lint checking of your git
repository; namely: you're on the right branch and you haven't forgotten
any autosquash commits (C<fixup!> or C<squash!>).


=plugin NoSmartCommentsTests
tests

This is an extension of L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles>, providing the
following file:

  xt/release/no-smart-comments.t - test to ensure no Smart::Comments


=plugin RemovePrereqsMatching
prereqs

This plugin builds on L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RemovePrereqs> to allow
prerequisites to be removed by regular expression, rather than string
equality. This can be useful when you have a C<DPAN> package consisting of
a bunch of modules under a common namespace, whose installation can be
handled by one common prerequisite specification.
