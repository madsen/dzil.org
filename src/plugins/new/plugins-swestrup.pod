=plugin BuildFile

During the 'BeforeBuild' phase of execution, this plugin creates or updates
one or more files and tests that they now exist. Later, during the
'AfterBuild' phase of execution the created or updated files are deleted,
unless the 'precious' configuration option was used.
Note that this plugin only generates the files on demand. In order to put
them into the distribution, a FileGatherer such as GatherDir must also be
run.


=plugin FileKeywords
file-munger

This plugin is a file_munger. It processes a list of files (by default all
files in the distribution) and replaces all occurances of known keywords
with their expansions.
It does this is in a manner similar to how Subversion manages keywords. In
particular it looks for keywords in the forms:


=plugin FileKeywords::Standard

This plugin is a plugin for the FileKeywords file_munger plugin. It defines
a few keywords that are common to all distributions.


=plugin Git::Tag::ForRelease
after-release git version-control version-provider

This plugin attempts to tag the current repository with an appropriate new
version number.


=plugin ReportPhase
after-release before-release file-finder file-gatherer file-munger file-pruner install metadata minting prereqs releaser version-provider

This plugin was written to give the author some idea of the order that
various roles are invoked under different conditions. So, B<ReportPhase>
implements every major role, and reports when it is being invoked. For best
results it should be used as both the very first, and the very last plugin
listed in dist.ini, as it will then report entering and exiting every
phase.
Other than this phase reporting, this plugin has no use.
