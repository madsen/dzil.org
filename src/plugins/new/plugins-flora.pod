=plugin DualLife
install

Dual-life modules, which are modules distributed both as part of the perl

Currently the only thing this module does is providing an C<INSTALLDIRS>
option to C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>'s C<WriteMakefile> function, so dual-life
modules will be installed in the right section of C<@INC> depending on
different versions of perl.
