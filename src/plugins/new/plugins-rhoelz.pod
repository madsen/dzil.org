This plugin adds a release test for your module that tests it against a set
of given perlbrew environments. Any dependencies are installed via
cpanminus into a temporary local lib, so your perlbrew environments aren't
altered. This comes in handy when you want to build against a set of
"fresh" Perl installations (ie. those with only core modules) to make sure
all of your prerequisites are included correctly.
