=plugin Pod2Html
documentation install

This plugin generates HTML pages from the POD files and puts them into the
distribution in a separate directory (not as a tree of files but flatten).
The created HTML pages have the same (or, at least, similar) style as the
modules' documentation shown at CPAN.
It creates HTML pages from all files in the C<lib> and C<bin> directory
that contain a POD section and that have C<.pm> or C<.pl> extension or that
have the word C<perl> in their first line. The plugin is run after other
plugins that may munge files and create the POD sections (such as
I<PodWeaver>).
