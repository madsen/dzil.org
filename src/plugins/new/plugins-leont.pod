=plugin BuildSelf
prereqs template

Unless you're writing a Build.PL compatible module builder, you should not
be looking at this. The only purpose of this module is to bootstrap any
such module on Dist::Zilla.


=plugin ModuleBuildTiny
prereqs template

This plugin will create a F<Build.PL> for installing the dist using
L<Module::Build::Tiny>.


=plugin ModuleIncluder
file-gatherer

This module allows you to explicitly include a module and its dependencies
in C<inc/>. At least one module must be given.


=plugin PPPort
file-gatherer

This module adds a PPPort file to your distribution. By default it's called
C<ppport.h>, but you can name differently.


=plugin Test::CheckDeps
prereqs template tests

This module adds a test that assures all dependencies have been installed
properly. If requested, it can bail out all testing on error.
