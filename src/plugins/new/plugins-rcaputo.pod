changelog file-gatherer git version-control

This Dist::Zilla plugin turns a project's git commit log into a change log
file. It's better than simply running `git log > CHANGES` in at least two
ways. First, it understands release tags, and it uses them to group changes
by release. Second, it reformats the changes to make them easier to read.
And third, subclasses can change some or all of the reformatting to make
change logs even easier to read.
See this project's CHANGES file for sample output. Yes, this project uses
itself to generate its own change log. Why not?
