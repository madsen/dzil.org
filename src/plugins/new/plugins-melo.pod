=plugin LatestPrereqs
prereqs

This plugin will filter over all your declared or discovered prerequisites,
contact CPAN, and adjust the version to the latest one available.
This will make sure that your module will be installed with the latest
version available on CPAN at the time you built your package.


=plugin MakeMaker::SkipInstall

This small plugin will edit the C<Makefile.PL> file, and override the
install target to become a no-op.
This will make your module fail the install phase. It will be built, and
tested but will never be installed.
