=plugin CopyMakefilePLFromBuild
after-release version-control

This plugin will automatically copy the F<Makefile.PL> from the build
directory into the distribution directory so you can commit it to
version control. When building directly from GitHub (via cpanm, for
example) you would need a F<Makefile.PL>.


=plugin CopyReadmeFromBuild
after-release version-control

This plugin will automatically copy the F<README> from the build
directory into the distribution directory so you can commit it to
version control. GitHub, for example, likes to see a F<README>.  As an
alternative, you can have a separate file (e.g. F<README.md>) for
GitHub.


=plugin SurgicalPkgVersion
version file-munger version version-insert

This subclass of L<PkgVersion|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion> ignores
files unless they have an abstract or a comment indicating that
PkgVersion should process them.
