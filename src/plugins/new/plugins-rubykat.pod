file-gatherer git version-control

This Dist::Zilla plugin writes a CHANGES file that contains formatted
commit information from recent git logs. The CHANGES file is formatted
using the "--format" option of the git log command. This makes it easy to
make the CHANGES file look the way you want it to.
This is based on Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ChangelogFromGit.
