=plugin >interact
command

This is a command plugin for L<Dist::Zilla>. It provides the C<interact>
command, which leverages the capabilities of L<Module::Build::Service> to
bootstrap an environment for your application which you can use to interact
with it.
It doesn't bother to examine the results or raise exceptions, since we
assume you'll assess how things are going by hand---since you've taken the
trouble to start an interactive session at all.
