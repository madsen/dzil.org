=plugin GitObtain
git version-control

This module uses L<Git::Wrapper> to obtain files from git repositories
before building a distribution.

Projects downloaded via git would be placed into the current directory by
default. To specify an alternate location, use the C<--git_dir> option.
This directory and any intermediate directories in the path will be created
if they do not already exist.


=plugin SvnObtain
version-control

Uses L<SVN::Client> to obtain files from a subversion repository for
inclusion in a distribution made with L<Dist::Zilla>.

C<[SvnObtain]> sections in your F<dist.ini> file describe a set of
Subversion repositories that will be downloaded into the current directory
prior to building a distribution. Subdirectories will be created that
correspond to the name of the projects listed in that section. Optionally,
after the URL of the subversion repository, you may specify a particular
revision to check out. If you do not specify a revision, C<HEAD> will be
used.


=plugin TemplateFiles
file-munger template

Utilize L<Text::Template> to turn certain files into templates. Each
template has available to it the C<$dist> variable that is the instance of
L<Dist::Zilla> currently running. Only those files listed in C<dist.ini> as
C<filename = blah> will be considered templates. Filenames are given
relative to the root of the build.
