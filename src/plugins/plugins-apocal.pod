=author APOCAL


=plugin Authority
file-munger metadata

Insert an C<$AUTHORITY> variable into each package and an
C<x_authority> key into your metadata that lists your (or the primary
author's) CPAN ID.


=plugin DualBuilders
install prereqs

This plugin allows you to specify ModuleBuild and MakeMaker in your
L<Dist::Zilla> F<dist.ini> and select only one as your prereq. Normally, if
this plugin is not loaded you will end up with both in your prereq list and
this is obviously not what you want! Also, this will block both builders
from running the testsuite twice.


=plugin MinimumPerl
prereqs

This plugin uses L<Perl::MinimumVersion> to automatically find the minimum
version of Perl required for your dist and adds it to the prereqs.
