=plugin SVK::Check
before-release version-control

This plugin checks that svk is in a clean state before releasing.


=plugin SVK::Commit
after-release version-control

Once the release is done, this plugin will record this fact in svk by
committing changelog and F<dist.ini>. The commit message will be taken from
the changelog for this release. It will include lines between the current
version and timestamp and the next non-indented line.


=plugin SVK::Push
after-release version-control

Once the release is done, this plugin will push current svk branch to
remote that it was copied from, but the associated tags need the mirror
name.


=plugin SVK::Tag
after-release before-release version-control

Once the release is done, this plugin will record this fact by creating a
tag of the present branch. You can set the C<tag_message> attribute to
change the message.

It also checks before the release to ensure the tag to be created doesn't
already exist. (You would have to manually delete the existing tag before
you could release the same version again, but that is almost never a good
idea.)
